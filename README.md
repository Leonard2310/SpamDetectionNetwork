# Spam Detector Network

## Project Description

In 2023, nearly 45.6% of all emails worldwide were identified as spam, down from almost 49% in 2022. While remaining a significant part of email traffic, the spam email share has decreased significantly since 2011. In 2023, the highest volume of spam emails was recorded in May, accounting for about 50% of global email traffic.

The project aims to build a spam email detection system using deep learning techniques, with a particular focus on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the BERT framework.

## Project Structure

### Dataset Used

- **Enron Spam Dataset**
  - **Description**: Contains emails from the Enron Corporation, labeled as spam or non-spam.
  - **Link**: [Enron Spam Dataset](https://github.com/MWiechmann/enron_spam_data)

### Technical Implementation

#### Data Collection

- Gathering a comprehensive dataset of emails labeled as spam and non-spam.

#### Data Preprocessing

- Removing stop words, stemming, and lemmatization.
- Transforming email text into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or embedding.

#### Model Building

- Using PyTorch framework and BERT model for deep learning.
- Fine-tuning BERT for email classification tasks.

#### Training and Validation

- Training the model on a training set and validating it on a test set.
- Utilizing cross-validation techniques to enhance model robustness.

#### Performance Evaluation

- Evaluating the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Analyzing false positives and false negatives to improve the model.

#### Deployment and Monitoring
